## The GET Method

**GET is used to request data from a specified resource.**

**GET is one of the most common HTTP methods.**

Note that the query string (name/value pairs) is sent in the URL of a GET request:

```
/test/demo_form.php?name1=value1&name2=value2
```

**Some other notes on GET requests:**

- GET requests can be cached
- GET requests remain in the browser history
- GET requests can be bookmarked
- GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
- GET requests have length restrictions
- GET requests are only used to request data (not modify)

## The POST Method

POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the HTTP request:

```
POST /test/demo_form.php HTTP/1.1
Host: w3schools.com

name1=value1&name2=value2
```

**POST is one of the most common HTTP methods.**

**Some other notes on POST requests:**

- POST requests are never cached
- POST requests do not remain in the browser history
- POST requests cannot be bookmarked
